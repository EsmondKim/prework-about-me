      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an attorney, and I'm transitioning to the computer programming field.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am a person who travels on nothing from nowhere to happiness.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Coding Boot Camp, listening to jazz music, learning to play jazz music, video games (retro gaming and video game emulation, Street Fighter 2 on my Arcade1Up or Pandora's Box, Animal Crossing New Horizons on my Switch, Fortnite on my Xbox One), cooking, relaxing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The job I have right now: Document Review Attorney at Consilio, LLC in Minneapolis and every job I have hereafter because I will always take jobs where I can learn, where I can contribute, where I can support my peers, and where my personality and work preferences find fulfillment.  Specifically, it would be exciting to start a coding career as a Jr. Web or Software Developer because I enjoy working with code and solving problems.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>South Minneapolis</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because I've spent a good amount of time the past few years really getting to know myself.  So, I can say, I know that as a web developer or computer programmer I will find opportunities where I can do good, fulfilling work.  I know I'll find environments where I can be myself while working with others to make everyone's life more logical, more intuitive, more meaningful, less stressful and easier to live.  Perhaps working with computers can even make the world more, if even marginally, egalitarian, just, stable, safe, secure, and thereby kinder and happier. I've spent the last 13 years as an attorney.  It was amazing to learn how legal code shapes societies.  Now, I am excited to learn how computer code shapes our world.  I suspect this journey will be every bit as impactful and transformative as my last one.   </p>
